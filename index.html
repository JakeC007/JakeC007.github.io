<p>In a more general sense, Jake is interested in tech policy &amp; digital rights, human computer interaction (HCI), and CS education. During the summer months, Jake has participated in NSF funded HCI research in both virtual realty (2018 REU) and unmanned aerial systems (2019 REU) . It is possible that Jake has a little too much fun with the subject matter.</p>
