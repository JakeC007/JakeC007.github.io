## What is the Culture, Computation, and Society Reading Group?

> Computers are impacting all of our lives - letâ€™s talk about it.

The culture, computation, and society reading group was a student-led seminar that I co-organized and co-led with Adriana K from 2019-2021. Comprised of students, staff, and faculty across the sciences, social sciences, and humanities, we mainly discussed relevant readings on key topics every other Wednesday. In addition to discussion, we will have interactive workshops and perhaps a guest lecturer or two.
