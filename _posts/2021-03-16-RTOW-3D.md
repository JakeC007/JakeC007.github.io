## Quick Fix For 3D Rendering 

I started working with the `plotly` package this week. I tried to render a visualization in my Rmarkdown file and ran into the following error.



> WebGL is not supported by your browser - visit https://get.webgl.org for more info



I thought this was rather odd since I went to the webgl website and my browser passed the check for webgl. Ultimately, I was able to solve this issue by forcing RStudio to render using "Desktop OpenGL."



### The Fix

1. Click on the "Tools" tab from the top bar
2. Select "Global Options"
3. Click on the "Advanced" tab
4. Under the "OS Integration Heading," change the rendering engine to "Desktop OpenGL"
