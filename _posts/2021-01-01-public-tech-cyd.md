In my experience as a college student, it has been tricky to find jobs that fall under the "Public Interest Technology" (PIT) umbrella. 

I recently attended a talk by Cyd Harrell about civic tech. Near the end of the talk, there were some recommendations on finding jobs within the PIT space. 

Below I have reproduced those recommendations taken from a public notes doc posted after the talk (link for the full set of notes [here](https://pad.riseup.net/p/djn_dec16_cydharrell-keep)!)
