This post is part of my series on getting into CS PhD programs from the perspective of a current (AY: 2020-2021) college senior. You can find the [master post here](https://jakec007.github.io/2021-04-19-swatties-guide-applying-cs-programs/). 

## Advice on the CS PhD Grad School Interview

Recall that this stage in the process is for the Professor to get a feeling of you as a person and to asses if the application version of you is an accurate representation of the real thing. Moreover, they are trying to get a handle on why you're going to grad school to figure out if (1) you're a good fit for their lab and (2) how likely you are to washout. 

With that in mind, here is some advice about the interview process that I received[^1]:

[^1]: Special thanks to Drs. Apthrope, Duncan, and Webb

* Be familiar with their work
  * Ensure that you are familiar with their publicly available ongoing projects. 
  * Ensure that you have a working understanding of 1-2 papers that they were first or final author on recently.
* Be prepared to give a good answer as to why you want to go to graduate school in general and $SCHOOL specifically  
  * This should be in line with what they read in your application package, but with more depth.
  * This should indicate that you have given serious thought to getting a PhD. 
  * This should communicate that you do genuinely want to attend $SCHOOL.
* Be ready to talk about your previous research (if applicable)
  * It is likely that they will ask you about how you overcame a challenge in your research.
  * If you haven't worked on a project in a while -- perhaps it was a summer research gig a few years back -- it is a good idea to refamiliarize yourself with what you did.
* Be prepared to discuss how you envision yourself building on their recent work by incorporating your skills/background
  * The Professor is looking to hire someone for a 4-6 year position. You want to give them every reason to pick you.
* Be prepared to ask questions at the end of the interview 
  * You should standardize your questions and record your answers. This will help with the decision process later. 



## Interview Prep

To prepare for my interviews I created a template that incorporates most of the advice above. I had a set of canned talking points to most things related to my research; this was committed to memory so I didn't bother to add them to my template. Note that I have a standard set of questions so that I can gather uniform data from each interview--though I rarely had time for every question. You should tailor these to your own interests. 



### Prep

#### Basic Facts

* Write down important basic facts of the professor. 
  * e.g how long have they been at $SCHOOL (this matters for the questions you can ask), what do they say on their website is the main focus of their research, etc.

#### Relevant SOP & Correspondence Content

* Enumerate the information that the professor already has about you. This will help ground you in the process and craft a cohesive narrative.

#### Ongoing Projects

* List the current projects that the professor is working on (if applicable).

#### Recent Paper Summaries

* Paper 1 [CONF, YEAR]
  * Summary
    * High level overview of paper
  * Methods
    * A basic understanding of the methodology of the study
  * Results
    * What did the study find/what was significant
  * Questions
    * List any "smart" questions that you have about the study. You may be able to pull this out during the interview.
* Paper 2 [CONF, YEAR]
  * Summary
    * High level overview of paper
  * Methods
    * A basic understanding of the methodology of the study
  * Results
    * What did the study find/what was significant
  * Questions
    * List any "smart" questions that you have about the study. You may be able to pull this out during the interview.

#### My Relevant Background

* What skills and relevant experiences make you a good fit for this professor.
