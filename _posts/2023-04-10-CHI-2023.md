## What We Found About Privacy and Security in K–12 Schools

When we started our research on technology in schools, we knew educational tools were everywhere. What we didn’t know was how deeply they might expose students’ personal information. Our study, *Uncovering Privacy and Security Challenges in K–12 Schools*, presented at CHI 2023, looked closely at how schools choose and manage the educational technologies they use every day.

### Why We Did This Study

Laptops, learning platforms, and apps are now essential parts of the classroom. But behind the convenience and innovation are big questions about privacy and security. Who collects students’ data? Where does it go? And what happens when that data is lost or shared?

We wanted to understand what schools actually do to protect student information, what challenges they face, and what risks might be hiding in plain sight.

### How We Did It

We interviewed 18 school officials and IT staff across 11 public school districts in the United States. Then we analyzed over 15,000 school and district websites to see what technologies they linked to or endorsed and what privacy risks those sites might pose.

### What We Found

1. **Schools face real privacy incidents but lack resources to respond.**
    Several districts had experienced ransomware attacks or data breaches. Many had no formal plan to handle them.
2. **Privacy awareness and training are limited.**
    Teachers receive training on how to use technology, not on how to protect student data. Even IT staff said they often lacked time and resources to review products for privacy and security.
3. **EdTech is often adopted without full vetting.**
    Teachers can easily bring new apps into the classroom, especially free ones. These tools may collect and share student-data in ways that schools never review.
4. **School websites link to technologies that track users.**
    Our web analysis found that many district websites and educational tools include trackers such as cookies, Meta Pixels, and session recorders. These can capture detailed information about how students interact with sites including user credentials.

### Why It Matters

Student data is valuable. It can include names, grades, attendance, and sometimes sensitive information about learning needs or behavior. When that data is mishandled, it can be used for advertising, shared with third parties, or exposed in breaches (these breaches happen a lot -- thousands of times a year). Yet most schools do not have the staff, training, or funding to manage these risks effectively.

### What We Can Do

We recommend that schools and policymakers invest in privacy training, stronger oversight of educational technologies, and clearer transparency about how student data is collected and used. Teachers should be supported to make safe technology choices, and students and parents should be informed about how their data is handled.

Students should not have to give up their privacy to learn. It should be part of how we define safe and equitable education in the digital age.
