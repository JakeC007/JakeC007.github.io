Serving as the Paper Chair’s Assistant for CHI 2025 was an eye-opening experience. Seeing firsthand how a conference of this scale comes together gave me a new level of appreciation for the effort involved. CHI has always been a conference I enjoy attending, and it consistently publishes excellent research, so having the chance to contribute to its organization was incredibly rewarding.

That being said, it was a Herculean task. Managing the various responsibilities required significant time and effort. To make the process more efficient, I wrote a set of scripts to automate some of the more repetitive and time-consuming tasks.

## Automating the Process

I’ve linked the repository for these scripts to this blog post, but you’ll notice that it is private. I made this decision as a precaution -- the inner workings of the process can be a bit messy, and I want to avoid the possibility of someone exploiting the system.

If you’re a current CHI Paper Chair -- or Paper Chair’s Assistant -- and could benefit from these tools, feel free to reach out with your ACM email, and I’ll be happy to grant you access. These scripts can help streamline the workflow and make the process a little more manageable.

Organizing a conference like CHI is no small feat, but with the right tools, we can make it a bit easier for everyone involved.
