### **Automating Privacy Policy Analysis: Insights from Our Multi-Year Research Project**

Privacy policies are essential in defining how our data is used and protected, yet their complexity often makes them inaccessible to the average person and difficult to analyze for researchers. To address this challenge, my team and I embarked on a multi-year research project culminating in a cutting-edge solution for scaling privacy policy analysis. This paper, now available on the PETS (Privacy Enhancing Technologies Symposium) website along with an artifact containing the code and data, leverages the power of large language models (LLMs) to annotate privacy policy documents using the **Governing Knowledge Commons - Contextual Integrity (GKC-CI)** framework. Here’s what we’ve achieved and why it matters.

#### **Key Findings:**

- **High Accuracy**: Our top-performing model achieved an accuracy of 90.65%, comparable to expert human annotators.
- **Scalability**: We applied this model to 456 privacy policies across various online services, demonstrating its capability to scale and handle diverse data.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Automating this process reduces the average annotation cost to as low as $0.23–$0.44 per policy, significantly undercutting the expense of manual or crowdsourced approaches.

### **The GKC-CI Framework and Its Importance**

The GKC-CI framework is what you might call “inside baseball” for privacy researchers—it’s a specialized way of thinking about privacy that focuses on the context of information sharing, like who’s involved, what’s being shared, and under what conditions. While it’s niche, it’s incredibly powerful for analyzing privacy policies and understanding the norms that shape our relationship with technology. However, this framework has traditionally relied on manual or crowdsourced annotations—approaches that are both time-intensive and costly.

Our work revolutionizes this process by automating GKC-CI parameter identification. This allows researchers to perform large-scale privacy policy analyses without compromising accuracy, paving the way for new insights into privacy norms and technology's role in shaping them.

### **The Role of Large Language Models In Our Project**

Large language models are proficient at processing and manipulating text at scale, making them ideal candidates for automating the annotation of privacy policies. We rigorously tested over **50 different large language models** to find the most effective model for our annotation task, ultimately finding that a fine-tuned version of OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 Turbo model performed best.

However, accuracy alone doesn’t paint the full picture. We also conducted a qualitative analysis of the errors made by our top-performing model to identify its limitations and areas for improvement. This holistic evaluation, which can be found in the paper, ensures that researchers using our tool can do so with a clear understanding of its capabilities and constraints.

### **What Makes Us Different**

While other studies have used machine learning to analyze privacy policies, our approach is different because we analyze these policies through a **privacy framework** called the GKC-CI framework (see above for a brief explanation). This allows for a nuanced analysis of privacy policies by looking at how information flows between different actors and whether this is appropriate in different contexts.

### **Takeaways**

We’ve created a tool that empowers privacy researchers to explore patterns and trends in privacy policies across industries and time. This opens the door to deeper investigations into how norms around data privacy evolve and how technology interfaces with these norms.

#### **What We’ve Made Public:**

- **Model Training and Production Code**: For full reproducibility.
- **Training and Testing Data**: To support future innovations.
- **Privacy Policy Annotation Files**: To enable further investigation.
- **Annotation Visualizer**: A user-friendly tool for examining individual annotated policies.
