title: Notes On Logseq for Task Management
---

I’ve been giving [Logseq](https://logseq.com/) a try, especially as a daily task manager. One thing that piqued my interest was the [Task Management Shortcuts](https://github.com/vipzhicheng/logseq-plugin-task-management-shortcuts) plugin because it adds a richer set of task states than Logseq provides out of the box.

Instead of the default `TODO` → `DONE` flow, the plugin gives you a whole spectrum of usable states:

```
"TODO" "LATER" "DOING" "NOW" "WAITING"
```

That extra nuance makes a surprising difference.
You can see what you’re actively doing, what you’ve deferred, what’s on deck, and what’s stuck.

But keeping track of everything can get tricky.

Logseq’s built-in agenda view tends to lump today, future, and overdue items together. When you’re juggling many tasks across pages, the signal-to-noise ratio gets tough.

So I built a few small queries to carve the mess into clean, focused lists:

* Overdue tasks
* Tasks scheduled for today
* Blocked & overdue tasks (using the `WAITING` state)

They’ve made my daily review dramatically clearer.

Below are the queries that you can plug n' play:



### Plug n' Play Queries

#### Overdue Tasks

```bash
#+BEGIN_QUERY
{:title [:b "Overdue Tasks"]
 :query [:find (pull ?b [*])
         :in $ ?today
         :where
         [?b :block/scheduled ?d]
         [(< ?d ?today)]
         [?b :block/marker ?m]
         [(contains? #{"TODO" "LATER" "DOING" "NOW"} ?m)]]
 :inputs [:today]
}
#+END_QUERY
```


#### Tasks Scheduled for Today

```bash
#+BEGIN_QUERY
{:title [:b "Tasks Scheduled for Today"]
 :inputs [:today]
 :query [:find (pull ?b [*])
         :in $ ?today
         :where
         [?b :block/scheduled ?today]
         [?b :block/marker ?m]
         [(contains? #{"TODO" "LATER" "DOING" "NOW"} ?m)]]
}
#+END_QUERY
```


#### Blocked & Overdue (WAITING + overdue)

These are tasks that *you* can’t move forward until someone else does.

```bash
#+BEGIN_QUERY
{:title [:b "Blocked & Overdue"]
 :query [:find (pull ?b [*])
         :in $ ?today
         :where
         [?b :block/scheduled ?d]
         [(< ?d ?today)]
         [?b :block/marker ?m]
         [(= ?m "WAITING")]]
 :inputs [:today]
}
#+END_QUERY
```

##### Later / Waiting Tasks (Unscheduled Only)
This is a catch all for tasks labeld LATER or WAITING but don't have a defined end date for when they should be handled
```
### Later / Waiting Tasks (Unscheduled Only)
#+BEGIN_QUERY
{:title [:b "Later / Waiting Tasks (Unscheduled)"]
 :query [:find (pull ?b [*])
         :where
         [?b :block/marker ?m]
         [(contains? #{"LATER" "WAITING"} ?m)]
         [(missing? $ ?b :block/scheduled)]]
}
#+END_QUERY
```
