title: The Wizard's Mirror
---

In a distant kingdom, a group of royal architects was tasked with designing a new marketplace for the townsfolk. The king wanted it to be the grandest, most efficient marketplace ever built. However, gathering input from the townspeople was a daunting task. The architects would need to travel to every corner of the kingdom, listen to countless voices, and sift through diverse—and often conflicting—opinions. It was slow, expensive, and exhausting work.

One day, a traveling wizard appeared in the royal court with a gleaming mirror. "Behold the Wizard’s Mirror!" he proclaimed. "This magical artifact can show you what people *would* want without you ever needing to speak to them. It’s quick, effortless, and far cheaper than wandering the kingdom. Simply gaze into it, and it will reveal a perfect vision of your marketplace!"

The architects were thrilled. They eagerly peered into the mirror, which displayed a dazzling image of a marketplace: golden stalls arranged in perfect symmetry, intricate fountains in every corner, and pathways paved with shimmering stones. "This is perfection!" they declared.

Using the mirror’s design, they constructed the marketplace in record time, saving the kingdom a fortune. When the gates opened, the architects waited eagerly to witness the bustling crowds and joyful commerce they had envisioned.

But when the townsfolk arrived, they looked puzzled.

The golden stalls were too slippery to hold their goods. The fountains took up so much space that there was barely room for carts or livestock. The shimmering pathways, while beautiful, became blinding under the midday sun. Worst of all, the entire market was laid out in a way that forced people to walk in endless loops, tiring them before they could visit all the vendors.

Within a week, the marketplace was abandoned. Vendors returned to their old dirt roads, and the shimmering pathways were left to glisten under an empty sky.

Frustrated, the architects summoned the wizard to explain. "Your mirror lied to us!" they accused.

The wizard shrugged. "The mirror didn’t lie. It showed you a vision based on patterns of what *might* be wanted, but it couldn’t understand what the people *truly* need. It’s a tool of convenience, not wisdom."

Realizing their folly, the architects set out to do the hard work they had initially avoided. They traveled the kingdom, spoke to the people, and learned about their daily struggles and desires. They discovered that the market needed sturdy wooden stalls, shaded spaces for livestock, wide pathways for carts, and places for families to rest.

The architects built a new marketplace based on what they had learned, and it became the heart of the kingdom—a bustling, vibrant place where everyone felt welcome.
