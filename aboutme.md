### Who Is Jake?

Jake Chanenson is a undergraduate student at Swarthmore College currently completing his senior year. At Swarthmore, he spends most of his time studying Computer Science and Linguistics. (Think of the interests as an XOR Venn diagram).

In a more general sense, Jake is interested in tech policy & digital rights, human computer interaction (HCI), and CS education. During the summer months off from school, he has done NSF funded HCI research in virtual realty and unmanned aerial systems.  He may have had a bit too much fun along the way.

### Current Whereabouts 

Currently, Jake is working at McGill University's Responsible Autonomy & Intelligent System Ethics (RAISE) Lab. He is investigating ethical risk in A/IS applications and learning a lot about tech policy & digital rights.
