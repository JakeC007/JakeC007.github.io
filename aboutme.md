### Who Is Jake?

Jake Chanenson is a CS PhD student at The University of Chicago working under [Marshini Chetty](https://www.marshini.net/) in the [Amyoli Internet Research Lab](https://airlab.cs.uchicago.edu/). Broadly, I'm interested in HCI, ethics and tech policy.



During the summer months, Jake has participated in NSF funded HCI research in both virtual realty (2018 REU) and unmanned aerial systems (2019 REU). In 2020, Jake secured a summer research grant to investigate ethical risk in A/IS applications at McGill University's Responsible Autonomy & Intelligent System Ethics (RAISE) Lab. It is possible that Jake has a little too much fun with the subject matter.
